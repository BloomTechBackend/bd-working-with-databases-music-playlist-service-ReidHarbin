# Music Playlist Service
This is a robust REST API for music playlist management, 
offering users the ability to execute various actions, including playlist creation,
reading, updating, and adding songs. To ensure secure and centralized data access, 
I integrated the Data Access Object design pattern, guaranteeing safe and 
consistent interactions with the underlying database. For improved code structure 
and maintainability, I streamlined dependency injection through the use of Dagger, 
enhancing modularity and scalability. Furthermore, I configured API Gateway 
endpoints meticulously, optimizing the routing of requests to their respective 
Lambda request handlers, thus ensuring efficient and seamless API performance.
